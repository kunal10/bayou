Playlist(Tuple store): Each server has one copy of this. hashmap<String, String>
WriteLog: Each server has one copy of this.
ServerId: Has a recursive field to previous server Id. 
    joinServer: should establish nc connections to all servers and do a creation write on one of the servers ?
    What will the starting server have for an Id and whom will it write a creation update ?
    stablize: timeout based on the number of servers in the system.
    pause: pause the thread which sends the anti entropy messages.
    start: release the thread  
    
Server:
    Playlist, WriteLog, IsPrimary, CSN, Version Vector
    Algos for :
        rollback 
        receive writes : resolve conflicts 
        receive reads
        anti-entropy
        retirement algo - removing from version vectors. handle primary retirement in this. 
        creation algo - you send back the server id.
        logic for pause and start
        logic primary ?? 
    Should you implement Bayou API ?  
    Different message types which a server should handle : 
        Retirement should also include whether primary is retiring 
        Creation
        Write from a server
        Write from a client
        Read
        Anti-entropy 
Client: 
    Has an instance of session manager ?
SessionManager: talks to the server. maintain a vector of read set and write set.
This is a set of WID's. 

WID : Server Id and accept stamp
